Comic Store API
Overview
This project is a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express.js, and Sequelize (MySQL) for managing a comic book inventory. The API allows you to perform CRUD operations such as adding new comic books, editing existing ones, deleting books from the inventory, and retrieving a list of comic books with features like pagination, sorting, and filtering.

Features
Comic Book Management API:

Create a new comic book.
Update the attributes of an existing comic book.
Delete a comic book from the inventory.
Comic Book List API:

Fetch all available comic books.
Support for pagination.
Filtering based on attributes like author, year, price, and condition.
Sorting by price, year of publication, or alphabetically by name.
Comic Book Details API:

Retrieve the full details of a specific comic book by ID.
Tech Stack
Node.js with Express.js (Backend Server)
Sequelize ORM (For database modeling and migrations)
MySQL (Database)
Postman (For API testing)
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (v14 or above)
MySQL (v5.7 or above)
npm (comes with Node.js)
Sequelize CLI (for running migrations and seeds)
To install Sequelize CLI globally:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g sequelize-cli
Project Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/comic-store-api.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd comic-store-api
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:

env
Copy code
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=comic_store
DB_DIALECT=mysql
PORT=3000
Database Setup
Create a MySQL database:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE comic_store;
Create a Model
To create a new model for the comic book, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name Comic --attributes name:string,author:string,yearOfPublication:integer,price:float,discount:float,numberOfPages:integer,condition:string,description:text
This command will generate two files:

models/comic.js: The model definition for the Comic table.
migrations/{timestamp}-create-comic.js: A migration file to create the comics table with the specified attributes.
Run the Migration
To create the comics table in the comic_store database, run:

bash
Copy code
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
Optionally, seed the database with dummy data:

bash
Copy code
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all

How to Run the Project
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Access the API: Open Postman or your browser and start sending requests to http://localhost:3000.

Testing
Use Postman to test the API endpoints.
Example collection is provided for testing CRUD, filtering, sorting, and pagination.
Middleware
Input Validation Middleware
File: middlewares/validateComic.js
This middleware checks if all required fields are present when creating a new comic book.
Running Migrations and Seeds
To run migrations:

bash
Copy code
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
To revert migrations:

bash
Copy code
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo
To run seeds (insert dummy data):

bash
Copy code
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
Postman Collection
You can import the provided Postman collection to test the API endpoints. The collection includes all the CRUD operations, as well as filtering, sorting, and pagination examples.

now update above according to my routes

const express = require("express");
const validateComic = require("../middlewares/validateComic");
const router = express.Router();
const ComicControllers = require("../controllers/comic-controllers");

router.post("/newcomic", validateComic, ComicControllers.create);
router.put("/comic/:id", ComicControllers.update);
router.delete("/comic/:id", ComicControllers.destroy);
router.get("/comic/:id", ComicControllers.get);
router.get("/comics", ComicControllers.getall);

module.exports = router;
